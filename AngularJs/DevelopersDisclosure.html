                        the earliest and easiest manifestation of a disclaimer. “No trespassing” alerts passing individuals
                        that they are near a private land boundary and also excuses the landowner of some liability if people
                        visit uninvited. Sometimes, the warning and limitation of liability are based on statutory law. For

                        horses has to have a specific sign to enjoy this protection from liability. This sign acts as a disclaimer
                        much like a “No trespassing” sign in that it informs and specifies limits on facility responsibilities:
